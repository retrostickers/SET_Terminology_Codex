# SET Terminology Codex GitHub README

Welcome to the **SET Terminology Codex**, the canonical reference for the **Scriptural English Trivium**. This codex documents terminology, principles, and interpretive frameworks derived from **SEG (Grammar), SEL (Logic), and SER (Rhetoric)**, forming a complete triadic system for Scripture analysis.

## Overview

SET (formerly SEG) is a structured framework for understanding Scripture **structurally, relationally, and covenantally**. It provides tools to analyze:

* **Grammar (SEG)** — letters, words, and internal textual architecture.
* **Logic (SEL)** — relational coherence between offices, episodes, and covenantal structures.
* **Rhetoric (SER)** — expressive, typological, and communicative manifestations of covenantal truth.

The codex includes:

* Canonical terminology with detailed definitions.
* Plane-based analysis (A-plane, V-plane, Z-plane, Covenant Plane, Conceptual Plane, Relational Plane).
* Principles such as **Grammar-anchored Absoluteness** and the **Interpretive Engine**.
* Applications across domains like Scripture, typology, music, mathematics, and linguistics.

## Usage

This repository serves as a **living reference** for scholars, researchers, and practitioners using SET to:

1. Analyze Scripture with relational and covenantal precision.
2. Identify structural, conceptual, and relational patterns.
3. Avoid assumptions or misalignments by following canonical verification.
4. Explore typological, mystical, and metaphysical insights with structural fidelity.

## Contributing

To maintain canonical integrity:

* All new entries must align with **SEG/SEL/SER principles**.
* Definitions should specify **planes accessed** and **relational/structural significance**.
* Contributors must preserve **triadic harmony and covenantal alignment**.
